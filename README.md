Lagotto allows a user to track events around research articles and other scholarly outputs, including how often a work has been viewed, cited, saved, discussed and recommended. The application was started in March 2009 by the Open Access publisher [Public Library of Science (PLOS)](http://www.plos.org/). Visit the [Lagotto website](http://lagotto.io) to learn more.

## Installation

Using Docker.

```
docker run -p 8050:80 lagotto/lagotto
